            text: 'We all know that consuming meat on a large scale is unsustainable in many ways. Still we do not collectively seem to suddenly stop eating meat. Therefore in the last years, more and more discussions, symposia and expert meetings are arranged to talk about the future of meat.'

            text: 'To simply stop eating meat would be the most easy solution but since we can already just do this, apparently it is not very attractive despite the increasing number of vegans and vegetarians. Other options are producing plant based meat alternatives (see my Faked Meat project), eating insects or refining the development of lab grown meat. Others see a middle way future where we eat mostly plant based and on rare occasions eat a small portion of organic, free range meat. These discussions focus on meat but eggs and dairy are as much part of meat production as meat itself. Probably the future will be a mix of all.'
