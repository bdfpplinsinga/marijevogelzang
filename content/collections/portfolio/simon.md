When we walk through a collectors house we see beautiful objects but we miss the scents, the movements and sounds of the past. Museum van Gijn is one of those places that actively tries to relive and revive the past through all the senses. It is a wonderful place to visit.'

She writes about ‘Korinte’ which meant ‘krenten’ (Currants) and uses a multitude of exotic spices very representative for the Dutch colonial activities of the 18th and 19th century. These ingredient created the base of the endlessly tested recipe for Simon.'

Copper is a soft material and every impression that is made leaves a trace. In this way, the objects are, not only because their shiny appearance, again a mirror of the past.'
