            text: 'I am fascinated by grazing as this seems such a distinct animalistic feature. We might look down upon it but we could also consider the sensuous aspects of banning the hands to aid us eat. By eating with tools we (literally) create a distance between us and what we eat. What happens when you can only pick up food with your lips and mouth. When the rules of the table are staged in a way that grazing suddenly seems a tempting act?'

The table is set up with a large variety of glass shapes (all upside down drinking glasses, bowls and bottles) that resemble a sky-line. The glasses are arranged on large sheets of acrylic with a laser cut pattern that fixes the glassware on the right position and are lit from underneath.'

The dishes are composed in a way so that every bite gives a sensation in temperature, texture or a slightly tingling sensation of pepper or mint. The table is rather narrow so the guests are close to each other and it is easy to speak.'

Focussing on the senses within the urban context reframes and ritualises the eating experience for a closer connection with their daily material: food.'
