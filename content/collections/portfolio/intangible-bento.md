            text: 'I feel intrigued by animism, the belief that everything, also lifeless objects or computers, have a soul. This is rooted in Japanese culture. I think, when you believe everything has a soul or a spirit, you will handle the things around you with more care. I am not sure if this counts for contemporary Japanese culture, looking at the current state of food- and plastic waste. But exactly this friction could be a base for my project.'

            text: "Visitors are invited to come down and enter the bento box. Inside the box they find a soul: The spirit of Bento. The spirit of Bento is a tiny character that has been living inside bento boxes for ages- since the first bento boxes were made. He talkes to\_ the visitors trough a ‘spirit-phone’ and guides them trough the installation."

            text: 'The installation is made of segments covered with thousands of ribbons. visitors walk trough the ribbons and discover places and objects and stories inside. The whole installation functions like a maze. Visitors feel the sensation of the ribbons touching their skins and hear the spirit talk to them about the intangible part of bento trough various objects. Visitors can leave their memories behind in a monument for memories of bento’s that have long been eaten. They can leave a sticker, a trace of microbes behind and connect physically trough the Spirit of bento symbolically visualising the human connection of all the unknown people that have grown, harvested, packed and prepared your food.'
