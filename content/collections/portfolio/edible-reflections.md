            text: 'In our life we seem to project everything to things outside of ourselves and to others but perhaps it’s time to take a look at ourselves first. You need to realise that nobody can actually see you. What a person sees when they see you is what they project onto you. You are doing this to others as well. What you see is different from what another person sees when looking at the same thing. As we can only see another human through our own set of specific glasses, instead of doubting the other, we can doubt our set of glasses as how we see someone is only our own interpretation of what we think we see. If we change the way we see things, we change how we see the other person as well. How do we change our glasses?'

I decided to have all guests be part of the experience by themselves and be coupled with a stranger. I let them actively play a part that is guided by an audio story.'
