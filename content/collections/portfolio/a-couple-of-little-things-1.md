            text: '‘A couple of little things’ is an eating experience dealing with the tension between the feeling of being lost and the warmth of belonging. We all build an identity around us which we feel connected to and that resonates who we are and want to be. Sometimes we might get dislocated or disconnected and feel insecure. Food can carry identity and belonging but it can also disrupt and confuse. ‘A couple of little things’ is a small sensorial journey exploring the sensitive expression of human kindness.'
