            text: 'After Tom Dixon, Snarkitecture, Jaime Hayón and Philippe Malouin I was invited to share my view on the material. It was the first time for me to work with such a solid material like Caesarstone. I was fascinated by the way Caesarstone is generally featured: as a shiny, cold and clean material central in the kitchen. Kitchens are everything but clean and cold. Kitchens are hectic places where life gets magically transformed into fuel. Kitchens are about life and death. About dirt and messiness. Kitchens are about the essence of life. It is where the raw material is transformed into edible poetry. I find it incredibly curious that the kitchen hardly ever gets presented the way it is: as the temple of life.'

Clearly, food production, sourcing, sharing and choice were all internationally topical. Knowing we wanted to demonstrate the possibilities of Caesarstone in this context, there really was only one designer we wanted to work with who would appreciate food AND design, as well as the Design of Food. Marije was able to bring all our dreams to life with an incredibly interactive and thoughtful installation, using Caesarstone as the conduit for a food journey from seed to food. It was our most popular installation, and in fact had people returning to the journey multiple times – and not just for the food!'
