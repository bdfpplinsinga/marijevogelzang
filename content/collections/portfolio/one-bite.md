            text: 'Everybody knows the story of Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden. It is a very well known story but also a story that many times gets interpreted in a very linear way. It seems as if human kind made a mistake by biting the apple. But the story shows us much more.'

            text: 'Adam and Eve were innocent in the garden of Eden. Everything was perfect and beautiful. From our perspective this seems like a wonderful thing. But when you only know beauty and no ugliness, when you only know perfect and no imperfection you will not be able to see it. You will be blind for it because we can only feel joy if we also know sadness. We can only acknowledge and appreciate true beauty and kindness if we have also experienced the opposite. Adam and Eve were like children. Children take the world around them for granted. It needs experience to develop the virtue of appreciation.'

Tension enables laughter and joy and stimulates the best music and art. Without darkness you would’t be able to perceive light. It is time to embrace the whole spectrum of life.'

The story leads them from focusing on their own senses to focusing on the person in front of them. A stranger. They are invited to project their own fantasy person or perception onto the other.'
