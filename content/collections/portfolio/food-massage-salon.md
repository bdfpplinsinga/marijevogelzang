You get stroked and massaged gently. Lovingly. You hear the voice of a stranger . Or is it? It’s the voice of your own tongue. Your tongue guides you and tells you stories about the unexpected parts of your mouth and the sensorial adventures you are about to embark on.'

I am full of thousands of sensors, I can move, I help you speak, I taste and can engage in full contact with body parts of other humans, if you know what I mean :)’'

After attending her talk in London in 2018, I immediately invited her to participate in the first edition of Melting. Marije came up with the Food Massage Salon which was quite an experience for those who benefit from this unique trEATment and also for the event because it was so catchy, and a super original approach. We managed to provide meaningful unforgettable moments! Marije has this great ability to make us pay attention to our senses, whilst making us think deeply, laugh, relax and even feel much better, I must as well mention her creative mind gym which is definitely worth it. Marije simply creates life changing experiences. What else can I say?"'
