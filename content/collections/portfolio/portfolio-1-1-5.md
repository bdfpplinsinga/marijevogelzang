            text: 'At the start of the dinner, guests were requested to hand in their phones to keep the experience no-tech. Still communication with others was highly supported by all the other guests at the table. The plates, filled with ball-shaped food on top of the rolling candy balls, were standing on disks. The disks all carried a clip to hold cards. Every guest had a stack of cards and a pen next to their plate so they could write a message to other guests at the table. All guests had to help push the messages across from one to the other.'

            text: 'Of course, the food was ball shaped to match the concept. We did the try out of this dinner at my wedding party just to find out how it works. There were many kids at my wedding and they loved eating the candy balls. Which was great fun! But it also meant the conveyor belt soon started to get ‘holes’ in the system and the disks weren’t able to slide across anymore. Lesson: If you do this at home, do not invite children or get more balls than seem to be needed in the first place.'
