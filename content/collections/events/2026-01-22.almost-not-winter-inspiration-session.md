title: "'Almost (not) Winter' Inspiration Session"
summary: |-
  By Terri Salminen - a collaborative, creative culinary project that involves bringing cooks, designers and food people together at the Food Design Playground in Dordrecht - the perfect place for inspirational meet-ups!

  I call this project “The Language of Food” because food and cooking communicate beyond words. I have created a year of (almost) monthly gatherings, each defined by: 

  . a different theme 
  . a culinary question or activity, and 
  . a guest who shares their unique food perspective
  . the sharing of good food prepared with thoughtful flavors
  . the time and place for conversation and a seat at the table

      The first edition of the Language of Food by Terri Salminen.

      The "Language of Food" project includes (almost) monthly gatherings, each defined by a different culinary theme, a culinary question or activity, and a guest who shares their unique food perspective. All gatherings involve eating good food, and time for conversation seated at the table!

      This first edition is called ‘Almost (not) Winter’ and is dedicated to composition and color palette explorations with winter’s most colorful ingredients (the kind that will keep you awake and hopeful until the first spring harvest).

      Marije Vogelzang will talk about why food design is relevant to day-to-day cooking practices in the kitchen. We will all eat together during a lunch that places citrus center stage. I will share ideas on how focusing on a (single) color of food inspires not just pretty dramatic plates, but also leads to seasonal cooking. Last but not least, we’ll talk about why we eat what we eat and how, and explore some creative food trend forecasting from a design studio from another continent.

      ‘Almost (not) Winter’ promises an abundance of things to learn, things to eat, and things to be inspired by!
