            text: '— it’s a language of sensation, connection, and imagination. She believes eating can reveal who we are, how we think, and how we relate to each other and the world. Her work makes the invisible rules of food visible, invites playful curiosity, and treats eating as an experience that is as meaningful as it is delicious. She sees food as a tool to question habits we mistake for truth — cultural blind spots, inherited rituals, unspoken hierarchies at the table.'
