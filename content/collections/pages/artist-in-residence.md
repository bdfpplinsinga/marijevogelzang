            text: 'Our residency program invites forward-thinking creatives to explore the world of food through a design lens. This season, our resident artist is delving into the emotional and cultural layers of eating rituals, using food as both medium and metaphor. With a background in interdisciplinary art and a deep curiosity for sensory experience, they are transforming everyday ingredients into thought-provoking installations, performances, and participatory experiments.'

            text: 'Throughout their residency, the artist engages with our community through hands-on workshops, open studio days, and informal tasting sessions — offering a unique glimpse into their evolving process. Their work challenges our assumptions about food, sparks meaningful conversations, and encourages visitors to see the act of eating in new and unexpected ways.'
